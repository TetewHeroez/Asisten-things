# 📘 Academic Assistant Materials Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive of academic resources that I created and compiled during my tenure as a **teaching assistant** for two university-level courses: **Calculus** and **Programming Algorithm**.

All materials in this repository were developed using **LaTeX**, particularly the Beamer document class for presentations, to ensure professional layout, clarity, and consistency. The use of LaTeX allows for precise formatting of mathematical notation and structured document design, making the content suitable for academic and teaching purposes.


## 📂 Contents

- 📊 **Lecture Presentations**  
  Carefully crafted Beamer-based presentation slides used to deliver or assist in class explanations. These materials are designed to be visually clear, concise, and pedagogically effective.

- 📝 **Assignments and Exercises**  
  Various problem sets and assignments, either given to students or used for practice sessions.

- ✅ **Solution Discussions**  
  Fully worked-out solutions and walkthroughs for selected problems, including explanations of the reasoning and methodology behind each solution.

- 🧠 **Supplementary Notes**  
  Additional summaries or concept explanations that were used to support students' understanding beyond what was covered in lectures.

## 🛠️ Technical Info

These materials were written primarily in **LaTeX** and are organized by course and topic. They reflect my effort to enhance the learning experience of students, encourage critical thinking, and provide structured resources for independent study.

> 📌 **Note**: This repository does not include any confidential or unpublished course material from the institution. All shared content is either created independently or adapted with permission.
